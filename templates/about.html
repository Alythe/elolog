        </div>
        <p>ELOlog is a place for you to keep track of your League of Legends game experiences. This helps you seeing your improvements faster and start working on whatever deficits you have.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can view your log entries in a graph, to see how your ELO changed since you started.</li>
          <li>ELOlog does not try to lock your data up, if you decide to stop using it you can export everything you entered as CSV formatted files.</li>
          <li>Registration is free and painless</li>
          <li>Your logs are private, no one can see them.</li>
          <li>If you want to share your logs you can publish them under a safe URL. Doing this enables all visitors (even non-registered) to view your log when you share the URL. This can be useful if you give lessons and want to watch the progress of your disciples.</li>
        </ul>
