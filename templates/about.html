        <p>ELOlog is a place for you to keep track of your League of Legends game experiences. This helps you seeing your improvements faster and start working on whatever deficits you have.</p>
        <p>You can view your log entries in a graph, to see how your ELO changed since you started.</p>
        <p>ELOlog does not try to lock your data up, if you decide to stop using it you can export everything you entered as CSV formatted files.</p>
